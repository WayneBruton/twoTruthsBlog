          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Vellum is a dynamic online method to ensure that your Standard
            Operating Procedures(SOP's) are read and acknowledged by your staff,
            contractors or any relevent individuals that deal with you and/or
            your organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            With more and more organisations allowing their staff to work
            remotely or outsourcing functions, you <strong>need</strong> a
            system that your staff, clients, contractors are made aware of how
            you expect them to operate and what your policies and procedures are
            in that regard.
            <!-- <a @click="goto">Hello</a> -->
          </p>
          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once you <em>register</em> you can then add policies (SOP's) and
            employees. You can also load personal personnel documents for a
            specific employee, user or contractor. The concerned employee /
            contractor etc then receives an email informing them that there are
            documents on the system that they are required to read and
            acknowledge. On the administators dashboard you can monitor
            compliance in this regard and take whatever necessary action you
            deem fit or that the organisation deems fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of documents or the number of employees / users you can
            load is entirely dependent on the <a @click="goto">package</a>

            that you have subscribed to. The initial <em>free</em> package
            allows you to <em>"test drive"</em> the system with up three users /
            employees and 200Mb worth of cumulative document size. Thereafter
            you will need to subscribe to a
            <a @click="goto"><em>"Paid Package"</em></a> suitable to your needs.
            In effect you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Load Policies (SOP's) as well as personal personnel documents on
              the system
            </li>
            <li>Create users / employees on the system</li>
            <li>
              Monitor compliance in regards to your policies and take corrective
              action
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Print reports, global and individual</li>
            <li>
              Email reminders to itinirent staff / contractors
            </li>
            <li>
              Delete policies and personnel documents
            </li>
            <li>
              Delete employees from the system
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
